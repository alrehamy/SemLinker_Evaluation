# Human Activity Recognition
The Heterogeneity Human Activity Recognition (HHAR) dataset from Smartphones and Smartwatches is a dataset devised to benchmark human activity recognition algorithms (classification, automatic data segmentation, sensor fusion, feature extraction, etc.) in real-world contexts; specifically, the dataset is gathered with a variety of different device models and use-scenarios, in order to reflect sensing heterogeneities to be expected in real deployments.

From this dataset we extract two new datasets: HAR-1, a dataset that contains human activity recognition data in the form of real time streaming records generated by "accelerometer" sensor in smart watches worn by human subjects, and  and HAR2, a dataset with similar streams generated by "gyroscope" sensor in the same experiments. The attributes of data in each dataset are described as following:


Index: a unique identifier.

Arrival_Time: the timestamp of subject arrival.

Creation_Time: the timestamp of recording the reading of the accelerometer sensor.

X: The X-axis of the sensor reading.

Y: The Y-axis of the sensor reading.

Z: The Z-axis of the sensor reading.

User: The user identifier was wearing the smart watch.

Model : The model of the smart watch.

Device: The type of the smart watch.

gt: the primitive activity performed by the user and sensed by the accelerometer (or gyroscope) sensor.


# Tagging
During SemLinker evaluation, we tagged this dataset with the concept G:SensorReading, a custom concept added to SemLinker global ontology and used to extend the abstract global concept sc:Dataset , that is default SCHEMA abstract concept, using the relation rdfs:subClassOf. The former concept is described by the following set of properties, note that each property is linked to G:SensorReading in SemLinker global ontology using the relation G:hasProperty.

"dc:id" : the id of the sensor reading record.

"dc:time" : the creation timestamp.

"G:sensor-type" : the type of sensor generated this reading.

"G:device" : the device used to generate this reading.

"G:model" : the model of the device used to generate this reading.

"G:reading" : the actual reading value(s) generated from the sensor.

As described in SemLinker paper, the system only require a tagging step, i.e., using the GUI to select  the concept G:SensorReading for the input dataset, and, upon connecting the dataset to SemLinker, the following RDF triple is automatically generated and added to the ontology:

HAR_1 M:isInstanceOf :SensorReading .

To this end, its SemLinker responsibility to map HAR-1 attributes to their semantically equivalent ontological properties in G:SensorReading. In optimal performance, SemLinker should output the following mappings:

 :dateCreated M:mapsTo IJ:Creation_Time .
 :sensor-type M:mapsTo IJ:type .
 :device M:mapsTo IJ:Device .
 :model M:mapsTo IJ:Model .
 :reading M:mapsTo IJ:X .
 :reading M:mapsTo IJ:Y .
 :reading M:mapsTo IJ:Z .

For the namespace IJ, I refers to the global identifier of the dataset, and J refers to its physical schema version. For example IJ of the gyroscope dataset in its default physical schema should be HAR_2_v1.0, empirically represented as URI, such as: http://www.har_2.com/v1.0/

As depicted above, the source attributes X,Y, and Z should all map to the same ontological property ":reading". In SemLinker's integration workflow, this is called attributes composition, an operation that aims to allow SemLinker to change the structure of the physical schema by virtually combining similar attributes and mapping them to the same semantically equivalent ontological property. The following record is a sample of gyroscope sensor streaming data:

0 1.4247E+12 2.79207E+13 -0.16218652 -0.022104237 0.05965481 a gear gear_1 stand

Although such record is stored in its native format, upon querying SemLinker is capable of returning the reading data as singular combined values in the form:

"-0.16218652,-0.022104237,0.05965481"

This is very useful for combining HAR-1 and HAR-2 datasets with other datasets where sensor readings are structured as single values not a decomposition of X, Y, and Z. In case the user requires retrieving the readings in manner that corresponds to the native structuring of the data, then the user can simple modify the structure of the concept G:SensorReading by replacing the ontological property "reading" with three new properties that correspond to X, Y, and Z values in the datasets, and SemLinker is automatically responsible of recompiling the mappings in order to link the source attributes of HAR-1 and HAR-2 to their modified tagging concept.
