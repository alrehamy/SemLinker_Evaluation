# Automatic Mapping Computations

SemLinker is an integration system that is capable, by relying on pluggable schema matching techniques, of automatically establishing mappings between two input schemas, one is a general schema (expressed in the form of ontological concept and its properties), and the second is a physical schema of an input dataset (data source), using a dedicated mapping computation algorithm. During SemLinker evaluations, we have chosen three different schema matching techniques, the theory and the source code of each technique are described in SemLinker paper. 

The mapping results in this repository aims to measure the accuracy of SemLinker’s algorithm, not the precision of the technique itself, hence we measure different aspects of the algorithm performances implicitly, such as; SemLinker’s ability to automatically handle schema evolutions, the algorithm’s ability to discover which attributes in a given physical schema should be composed together, or decomposed from each other. We also aimed to measure how the meaningfulness of a label string (linguistic semantics) can boost the precision of the schema matching technique.

In the results file, each spreadsheet describes the output mappings automatically obtained by SemLinker using every schema matcher plugged into SemLinker, when a mapping is captured between an ontological property and a source attribute, we label the corresponding cell by 1, and zero otherwise. The first column in each spreadsheet gives the gold standard mapping, and the binary values in the remaining columns indicate whether SemLinker was successful in establishing the gold map.
